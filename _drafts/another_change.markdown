excerpt: The choice of change.

I was having a conversation yesterday with a friend who was getting ready to change jobs.  He know that I had recently been through a similar change and wanted some advice on the transition.  He advised that I blog about the experience and my advice.  So here I go.

### Making the decision

First a little important background information about the job I left (this is important for the next part of the story).  I was a technical architect at [Phase2](http://www.phase2technology.com/).  I was well respected in my position (by most) not only within my company but also within the Drupal community which I served with pleasure.  I was able to work on extraordinary projects to the scale that most developers will never see.  I lead an [open source effort](https://groups.drupal.org/large-scale-drupal-lsd-projects-and-plans/content-staging) to improve Drupal by solving a very difficult problem.  I was also paid very well.

Making the decision to leave my job was not easy.  There were several good reasons to stay.  I had a secure job, liked my co-workers, had a great boss and mostly enjoyed what I was doing.

So why did I leave you ask?  That's not a simple answer.  I had been working in Drupal for 4 years and I was itching to do something different.  I had worked for a smaller company (Treehouse Agency) which merged with Phase2.  The year after the merger I just grew apart from the company.  Phase2 is a great company to work for, if you are a Drupal dev, I highly recommend it.

### The Choice of Change

After 4 months of reflection, I know I left because of change.  Even though this change was for the best of the company and its employees, it wasn't my choice.  And there lies the root of the issue.

*I left Phase2 because I wanted the change to be my choice.*

Feeling in control is important to me, it's my greatest strength and weakness.  I even know that most of the control which I so fondly hold on to so tightly is an illusion.  A version of reality which makes me comfortable.  The illusion of control is a powerful motivator.

### Buyer's Regret

So I left Phase2 to work for [Appirio](http://appirio.com/) as an engineer on the R&D team.  It sounded like the coolest job ever working on a product at a fast growing tech company.  Best of all, not working with clients.  I have stock options, we are [very well funded](http://appirio.com/2012/03/15/appirio-raises-60-million-in-series-d-funding-led-by-general-atlantic/) and I have ultimate flexibility about how and where my job gets done.  So why was I thinking I made a huge mistake?

I had a few moments of weakness where I drafted emails to send to my previous employer to ask for my position back.  It's important to realize this is not a fault and we are not all perfect.  Decisions are analyzed and you start playing the "what if" game.  

Along with the illusion of power, I also place a high value on respect.  I didn't realize how import respect was to me until I made this change.  Go search for ["the importance of respect"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=importance+of+respect) and you can see what I should have known.  Respect is so important to a man that even the Bible states it as one of the primary drivers in our decision making. ([http://loveandrespect.com]).  How can I get more respect?

The new job is great.  The regret came because I went from a well respected technical architect to an engineer.  I didn't feel empowered, I didn't know the product and my suggestions weren't listened too.

### Realizing the Choice

It took me months to come to grip with the fact that I didn't know what I was talking about.  I was working on a new product, with a new programming language and integrating with new systems.  I had no idea what I was talking about.  I should have just shut up and listen.  Instead I continued to make suggestions that weren't (and shouldn't have been) taken as fact just because I had made the suggestion.

It wasn't until I gave up the idea that I knew anything (which I really didn't) that I began to learn more and progress.  It's only been 4 months but I'm already influencing the direction of the product.

### Take the Time to enjoy the Change

My main advice after going through this is to embrace all changes and enjoy the changes you choose.  Take the time to learn your environment and listen!  No matter how important you felt at you previous position, you will not feel that immediately at your new position.

I know that I'm being a better engineer and person.  The exercise and lessons I have learned and continue to learn will lead me to my next adventure.
