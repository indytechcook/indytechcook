excerpt: Don't let yourself get caught up in the myth of contributing to open source

Contributing to Open source is wonderful.  There is actually a good change that you are already contributing and you don't even know.  

During my career I've been fortunate to be part of many different companies.  I've worked with a large, multi-national enterprise pharmaceutical company, the third largest engineering and architect from in the world (at that time), mid size software development/consulting companies, a large hospital system and a small less then 10 person company.  The range of processes, attitudes and number of people varied greatly between companies.  

In all of these companies, the ones that had the best culture were the ones who embraced open source contribution.  I don't' think that pattern was accidental.  I've seen that contributing back to open source has made my fellow employees more satisfied with their work.  They feel like they are part of a something greater then themselves.  It sadness me when I speak to those who don't understand what it means to contribute to open source.  The potential of greatness that can be achieve is magnified when you work with so many great people.

So I'm here to help those of you to get past any myths that are holding you back form contributing to open source.  I also hope to provide those of you who are attempting to convince your company of what can be accomplished by contributing to open source.  Let's debunk these myths!

### Myth #1: When we open source our code we lose all of our IP and competitive advantage.

This is the big one.  The myth that is the most popular argument.  This is most people's argument against open source.  Let's debunk it!

Most people believe they have the 1% of code that is unique and can not be duplicated.  Help your company realize where their true value proposition lies.  I don't advocate in open sourcing all code all the time (though open sourcing an entire product can be good), just common code.
