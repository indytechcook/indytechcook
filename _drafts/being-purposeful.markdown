excerpt: Be proud of what you are doing

Life is short and time is precious.  Why I continue to waste this precious time is still a mystery.  I continually struggle with keeping myself productive.  Not just productive in a business sense, but also in my personal life.  This was brought to my attention, again, by the 4-Hours Work Week. A continually theme through out the book was to ask yourself if you are working on a critical path task.  Before you can decide if a task is in the critical path, you have to know what your path.  I still have sat down and done the definition in the **D**EAL acronym.  I don't really know why yet, I just haven't.  Instead of thought more about the use of my time in a larger context.  I ask myself "Are you adding value?".  To help myself become better at answering "yes" to this question, I sat down and made a schedule for what I'd like a common day to look like.  This is not what my day currently looks like, this is what I want my day to look like.

### 6am: Wake up

I'm trying to eliminate caffeine and I don't want to wake anyone else up with the noise of my coffee grinder, so hot water with lemon and ginger help me get started.

### 6 - 7am:  Read motivationally, actionable book/text and get ready for the day.

It's important this not be on my computer so I can eliminate other distractions.  These books need to get my mind moving and get me motivated for the day.  Examples books would be

* [The 4-Hour Workweek](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357)
* [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/How-Friends-Influence-People-ebook/dp/B003WEAI4E)
* [48 Days to the Work You Love](http://www.amazon.com/Days-Work-You-Love-ebook/dp/B004HILUFU)

Another variable on this part of the schedule could be just to wake up, get ready and as I drive into the office (if I drive into the office) and listen to them in audiobook style.  I actually do this now and like it.  This could also be used to listen to podcasts like the TED Radio Hour.  Though, now that I think of it, I'd rather read those books then listen to the podcasts rather then listening to the audio books.  Also, I want to keep some sort of recording device in the car to help remember thoughts from the podcasts.

### 7 - 10/11am  Complete a Critical Path Task(s)

At this point in the day, I still haven't checked my phone or my computer for new emails and I still won't.  I already have my tasks for today lined up and I begin on the most important.  I remove as many distractions as possible so I can complete this task as quickly as possible.  I still keep myself available for any urgent tasks on instant message, I realize that I need to keep others priories in mind at work.  Other people rely on my work and I don't want to be the one to hold them up.  

### before lunch: Check Email

This is the first time I will check email for the day.  I don't spend much time in the inbox, instead focusing on either completing the task for the email, delegating or setting it as an action item.  I'm working on a blog post about how I process my inbox during these sessions. 

### Lunch:  Mmmmmm… foood…

This is a good time to relax the mind.  Either watch a funny video, get on Facebook, etc.  It's important to have break in your day, especially after the jammed packed morning of productivity.  Even better, have lunch out with someone you admire.  Exercise those social skills.

### After Lunch - 2/3:  The Next Task

If I didn't complete all of my critical path tasks for the day, I do that now.  It's important to come back from lunch with a focused task since it's easy to lose focus.

### 2/3 - 4ish:  Brainstorming/Flex Time

With the feeling of accomplishment from completing another task, it's time to be creative.  Your mind is primed for creative thinking in the afternoon.  You are a little tired so it's harder to focus on a single task.  Your mind wants to wonder so let it!  

First I see if I need solve any complicated problems.  These normally require creative solutions.  

If I don't have any problems at work to solve, then I'll turn to other areas.  Any new ideas get added to my task list and I'll sketch out mind maps.

If I have nothing to really think about, I might spend some time with the kids, read a book or watch a movie.  I always make myself available if anything urgent comes up, but it never does.

### 4 - 5:  Workout

I want to workout ever day.  I have a [PT that I go to](http://joesfitness.net/) twice a week to keep me focused on what I should be working on.

### 5 - kids go to bed:  Dinner and Family Time

This is one of my favorite parts of the day. Enough sad.

### After kids go to bed: Writing

I really want to become a better writer.  So I'll practice with writing to my blog every night.  I might not publish every night, but I might work on an article for a few days.

### Before Bed: Reading

I like to read before bed.  It has to be a certain type of book or I'll be up all night.  I like fiction books which make you think but are actionable.  Books that challenge traditional thought like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is one of my favorites.

### Summary

The schedule itself it's what's important, it's accomplishing my goals for the day.    These goals are both professional and personal.  You notice how I don't differentiate between my "work" tasks and my "home" tasks.  I just have one task list and set of priorities.  Here is what I want to spend time on each each:

1. Complete Critical Path Tasks
2 Reading
* Writing
* Family Time
* Self Improvement  
* Workout

Implementing a schedule is a great way for me to make sure I'm continue on my journey though life in the most effective way possible.
