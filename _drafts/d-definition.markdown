excerpt: Defining your goals is what makes all of the hard work worth the time.
---

This is the post I have been putting off.  Implementing a few of the concepts from the 4 Hour Work Week was easy.  But I skipped a step.  The most important step.  Defining why I was eliminating and automating.  I skipped it because it's hard.  Really hard.

### The Problem

After I implement a [daily schedule](http://indytechcook.com/being-purposeful) (which I'm not consistently following) and [reduced the constant checking of my email](http://indytechcook.com/email-processing), I found that I had a lot of free time.  I didn't know what to do with this extra time I ended up resorting to non-value adding tasks.  I bing watched Netflix (this is what I call watching most of a season in one day) and surfed the internet more.  I really started to not like what I was doing.  It and only been 2 weeks and I was already getting bored with the extra time.  This was because I failed to define anything to fill the extra time. So here I go, defining what my goals are to fill the extra time.  Time to add real value to my life. 

### How to Define

Before I decide what to define, how should I define it.  Yes, this might be another stall tactic but I do think it's important to think about what types of goals.  The Four Hour Work Week does a good job in helping guide you in this area.  Let's review some pointers.

There are several ways to define your goals but let's stick with [Tim's method](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/4-hour-workweek-tools/#chap4).  He calls it "Dreamlining""  THese are all themes I pulled from The Four Hour Work Week's Define chapter.  These are just high level, you can find much more detail from his book.

* Make the goals big
* Keep the timelines short
* Don't judge or fool yourself

##### Definition Steps

1. Make goals in the following areas (in order)
    1. **having** (including but limited to material items)
    2. **being**
    3. **doing**
3. Convert Being into Doing
4. Select four dreams from the initial list.  These are the most important and most exciting.
5. Determine the Cost of the Dream.

### My Definition

Here we go, the reason for this post and what should send me on a more directional path through life.  Let's hope that I'm not blowing this out of proportion.  I also need to remind myself that these are *my* goals and not necessarily my wife's for family goals.  They need to all sync up for this to be really successful.  I'm working on getting my wife to do this same exercise.

#### Goals

**Having**

* New Custom House - 12 months
* New Look/Style - 12 months
* Cleaning Service - 6 months
* Promotion - 12 months
* A mentor - 6 months

**Being**

* Patient/Good Listener - 6 months
    * Doing: Attend social event more regularly
* Fluent in Spanish - 12 months
    * Doing: have a 15-min conversion with a native

**Doing**

* Contribute more to Open Source - 6 months
* Write a book - 12 months
* Have a monthly lunch with someone I admire - 6 months
* Win a weight lifting competition - 12 months

#### Selected Goals

* 12 month
    * New House
    * Write a book
    * New Look/Style
    * Win a weight lifting competition
* 6 month
    * Have a monthly lunch with someone I admire
    * Contrite more to Open Source
    * Attend social events more regularly
    
#### Target Monthly Income

**New House**: We are already building a house we estimate to be $400K.  I want to put down 20% so I need $80K.  I already have $42K saved up and left over from selling the last house so I just need $38K more.  Let's add another $15K to furnish the house or whatever (we have a house full of stuff in storage that I would like to just sell).  The cost of the house will also increase what we currently pay in rent by $1,450.  Some utilities will go down but others will go up so let's add another $500/month for other house related stuff.  Totals:(53,000/12) ~ 4400/month for the next year then 1,950/month after.

**Write a book**: Time, and lots of it.

**New Look/Style**: I want a personal stylist to help me select cloths that look good on me.  Most high end stores offer this service for free.  Good quality clothes are expensive.  Let's say a new outfit costs $500.  If I get 5 new outfits that $5000.  So $5000/12 ~ 400/month.

**Win a weight lifting competition**: I already have a trainer I go to twice a week so no new costs here.  Just time and dedication.

**Have a monthly lunch with someone I admire**: Time and confidence to contact them.

**Contrite more to Open Source**: If I work this right, I will actually get paid to do this.

**Attend social events more regularly**: Time

**Total New TMI**

* 4400 for house + $400 for clothes = $4800/month
* Current expenses ~ $2,500/month
* Total TMI: $4,800 + $3,250 ($2,500 * 1.3) = **$8,050**
* TDI (Target Daily Income): **~$270**

***I should be able to live my new lifestyle for the next year at $270/day.  This all of the sudden seems really doable.***


### Follow my Progress

I really want to go into detail about each of these goals, what they mean, why I choose them and how I plan on achieving them but that is a blog post per goal.  I'm going to start by using [workflowy](https://workflowy.com/?ref=cc89f9d) to share [my progress on each step](https://workflowy.com/shared/3d0efacd-b6ca-4a2d-41a4-c4c154975653/).  I'll also blog more about details for each goal, the progress and the thought behind them.

### Why?

I do not expect anyone to read these blog posts.  I'm writing them for me.  But just in case someone does read this (or I forget why I did them), here is why.

**I believe in transparency.**  We should be able to share and discuss our thoughts, dreams and ideas in a public forum with out being ridiculed.  Sharing should enhance our lives and make us all better people.  

**I need accountability.**  I really want to be a better person but I have a hard time focusing.  Writing out what I have done and my thoughts will help me keep in target and honest.  It's easy to catch me lying to myself when it's as public as the internet.

**I want to make others better.**  I strive for continually self-improvement.  At any given time I am the worst version of myself and I really look forward to being a better version.  This means I'm always focused on the future.  To many people struggle through life and if documenting my journeys can lead them to a  better life then I know it's worth it.

### Share with me

I want to hear from anyone reading this.  Do you like it?  Do you hate it?  What would you improve?  How would this be more useful to you?
