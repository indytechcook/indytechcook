excerpt: Sticking to a schedule is difficult and I might not be cracked up for such a level of organization.

A few weeks ago I wrote about [being more purposeful with my day](http://indytechcook.com/being-purposeful/). In that post, I laid out a high-level schedule of what I would like a day to look like. It sounded great in theory, but I totally forgot that I don't like schedules; I like to work on what I want to work on when I want to work on it. Most importantly, I have two young kids so schedules for myself are pretty useless. 

### Learning a new technique 

In researching different email processing techniques ([see more about email processing in my past blog post](http://indytechcook.com/email-processing/)), I found a few comments from people who used higher-level lists. They created lists by project similar to how I was processing my email, but instead of specifying what tasks they will do in a day, they say which project they will work on during that day. The day should have a theme, like do all business development tasks together on Monday or power through accounting tasks on Thursday. For me, this will be how I focus my free (non-work) time. This is a good implementation of "[batching](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/?s=batching)" which is discussed in The 4-Hour Work Week. A great example of this process is used by [Michelle](http://www.bombchelle.com/about/) from [Bombchelle](http://www.bombchelle.com/) . I liked this idea and started to try it out. 

I already had the project and lists started. What I needed was to organize which days would be dedicated for what. Currently, I'm just picking a project for the next day, but I'm sure this can and will need to be optimized. Sounds like another blog post! 

### Any.Do 

In my never-ending search for the perfect to-do list manager and productivity tools, I came across [Any.do](http://www.any.do/). This is an extremely simple task manager with an elegant UI. Everything from the design of the website to the task reminders screams simplicity. This is working out well; I already have an [organization system](http://indytechcook.com/email-processing/) using [ActiveInbox](http://www.activeinboxhq.com/referrals/?rc=9bim2k2131a&eh=dd6b6bf6005c43eabc894018cb03b641), so all I needed was a simple way to assign a list of tasks to a day. 

### Creating the list 

Every night before I go to bed, I create a task list for the next day. I start [the list](https://workflowy.com/shared/20beedf5-e90e-ee5e-0e76-1df59e6c1834/), select the projects I want to work on, then go to my ActiveInbox and find the next task. This is the last thing I do before I do my nightly reading before bed. Immediately after the list is created, I shut down my computer. Yes, sometimes I have thoughts about the tasks, sometimes I'll jot a few notes down in Any.Do for the next day; but most of the time reading shoves those thoughts out of my head. 

Any.Do is great at gently reminding you what tasks you have left during the day. I'm using this over the Today tag that I spoke about in the email processing blog post because it keeps me 100% out of gmail. I found myself still going into the inbox when I was looking at today's tasks. Less distractions has helped me focus even more. 

The task list I create is a task list for the day. It includes work, personal, family, and self-development items. This is an all-inclusive list. It's normally a pretty large list also. I never actually completed the entire list in a day. That's okay since the Any.Do chrome plugin makes it easy to drag a task from one day to the next. 

Here is what my task list looks like for tomorrow:

Now I have a more focused list of tasks that I can work on throughout the day. I still try to reserve certain times of the day for certain activities. For example, I like to run/workout in the afternoon, I like to code in the morning, and I like to write in the early morning or evening. These have more to do with utilizing how your mind works most efficiently than personal preference. 

*A special thanks to [The Bomchelle Blog for giving some great reviews of tools](http://www.bombchelle.com/category/toolsresources/). I'll be making some more changes in my action lists here soon. Stay tuned! *

As always, I really look forward to any comments you have!!
