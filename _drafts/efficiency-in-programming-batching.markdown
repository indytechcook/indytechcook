excerpt: Batching similar programming tasks together has made me more efficient with my time.

This is the first blog post in a series called "Efficiency in Programming" where I will apply techniques I've learned to programming an other technical tasks.

The first technique I implemented was batching which was introduced to me via [The 4-Hours Work Week](http://fourhourworkweek.com/) by [Tim Ferris](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/about/).  This will be the easiest task to implement as it doesn't or change in how I program but in when I program.

In my post Still [Trying to be Purposeful](http://indytechcook.com/still-trying-to-be-purposeful/), I talk about assigning a theme for the day and working on tasks from that theme.  This same concept  is applied to programming.

### Before Batching

Say you are working on a complicated software development project, you have user stories, issues questions by email all about different components.  These components, while all related, are actually all contained within their own scope.

In your normal workflow you would look at your project/task/issue management tool, whether it be [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Rally](http://www.rallydev.com/), [Cloud Enablement Suite](http://appirio.com/technology/cloud-enablement-suite/) (which I help develop!) or some awesome home grown system and look at all of the different queues.  These queues are all arbitrary filtered lists.  The actually items in the list could include bugs, new features, documentation requests or a vast array of other tasks and assigned to different components of the system you are building.  The important part to remember is that the filters can be changed.

Normally I would work off of a listing by priority with the highest priority first.  I started with the P1 items downy to the P4 items.  The actually content of the item did not matter to me.  My day contained a mix of issues, stories, support requests and documentation all against different area of the product.  I thought this is how I was supposed to work.  

This is how I had always thought I had to work.  No one told me that all they really wanted is for me to produce by a certain deadline.  The actually order of tasks isn't really relevant (there is always an exception for down systems).  I assumed this was the most effective use of my time without really analyzing what I was producing or asking the product manager how he really wanted me to deliver.

### Figuring out what to Change

Since readying The 4-Hour Work Week then subsequent other books, blogs and podcasts; I reevaluated how I was working.  Was I really being efficient?  Was there a better way?

I stared to analyze what was really in these queues I was working.  What were the similarities and differences?  What did I like working on and what was most frustrating?  Could I element or automate any of it?  What is really expected of me to deliver?

After some self-reflection and discussion with my product manager, I came up with the following answers.

* What were the similarities and differences?
    * Types of requests (issue, story, support request, documentation)
    * Components of System
* What did I like working on and what was most frustrating?
    * I enjoyed new features and some issues.
    * I dreaded support requests and documentation
* Could I eliminate or automate any of it?
    * I can automate using [CloudSpokes](http://www.cloudspokes.com/), my company's crowd sourcing solution.
* What is really expected of me to deliver?
    * We have monthly sprints.  As long as all of the stories and issues assigned during that sprint were complete before code freeze all was right with the world.
    
The last point is probably one of the most important.  I found out the expectation was just to deliver it all by a deadline and not work issues in order.  There was the occasional exception where an off-cycle release required a shuffle in my priorities but that was the exception and not the rule.  I found out I am blessed to have a manager and product manager that does not micro manage when and how I complete my work as long as it gets done.  It was a very liberating feeling.

### The new system

With this new information in hand and using techniques I learned from [Bombchelle](http://www.bombchelle.com/2012/how-to-manage-your-time-energy-when-its-split/), I went about reorganizing when I work on my requests.  I batch together requests are similar components, am purposeful about which type of request I worked and look to send any request possible to [CloudSpokes](http://www.cloudspokes.com/).  I'm currently working on three main areas at my job:  [CloudFactor](http://www.cloudfactorapp.com/), learning Java and implementing an open source culture.  I also have the following areas outside of my job: freelance work, blogging, self-development.  I'm most effective when I batch tasks together.  I used to work only spend a few spare hours a night on my freelancing and found myself working way more hours then I budgeted due to being very ineffective.  

Here is how I'm going to try to break down next week.  That's right, next week.  This is an ever changing plan.  Sunday night, I jot down in my notebook what I want to work on each day at a high level. Currently I don't have many issues in CloudFactor since I'm working on learning Java so there isn't any need to batch by subsystem.

* Monday:  CloudFactor all day. Issues in the morning, then new stories after.
* Tuesday:  Learn Java
* Wednesday: Freelance work in the AM.  Open Source contribution implementation in the afternoon or CloudFactor depending on priorities. 
* Thursday: Learn Java
* Friday:  Freelance work in the AM.  Blog, write or active self or business development (not just reading a book) in the afternoon.

The Weekend is reserved for family time.  

Evenings (after the kids go to bed) are spent either socializing, talking with my wife, reading or writing.  Nothing to intense unless I have a looming deadline.

I started batching tasks almost a month ago and I become very effective in my work at both my job and freelancing.  I even [wrote about the increase amount of free](http://indytechcook.com/d-definition/) time I didn't know how to use.

This same thought process could easily be applied to sub-systems.  What's important is that you group similar tasks together?  Once you are deep in a certain area or subsystem, it is best to stay there until you are finished with it.  The amount of energy needed to switch context can easily loose you 30 - 40 minutes of productivity.

Of course batching in the programming since can also refer to batching like process taking advantage of already filled caches but that's a great subject for another blog post.

[When I create my task list for the next day](http://indytechcook.com/still-trying-to-be-purposeful/) I keep these guiltiness in mind to keep my work focused for the day.  It's important to be as strict as possible to your schedule.  Find out the real priories of tasks, they are not all emergencies.  While this schedule looks like I'm slacking off at my job it's completely the opposite.  I'm more effective and less distracted at the tasks I'm working on.  I know what I'll be doing that day and know that I can completely concentrate on the project at hand.

If you have any tips that have helped your effectiveness, please share!
