excerpt: Batching similar programming tasks together has made me more efficient with my time.

This is the first blog post in a series called "Efficiency in Programming" where I will apply techniques I've learned to programming an other technical tasks.

The first technique I implemented was batching which was introduced to me via [The 4-Hours Work Week](http://fourhourworkweek.com/) by [Tim Ferris](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/about/).  This will be the easiest task to implement as it doesn't or change in how I program but in when I program.

In my post Still [Trying to be Purposeful](http://indytechcook.com/still-trying-to-be-purposeful/), I talk about assigning a theme for the day and working on tasks from that theme.  This same concept  is applied to programming.

### Before Batching

Say you are working on a complicated software development project, you have user stories, issues questions by email all about different components.  These components, while all related, are actually all contained within their own scope.

In your normal workflow you would look at your project/task/issue management tool, whether it be [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Rally](http://www.rallydev.com/), [Cloud Enablement Suite](http://appirio.com/technology/cloud-enablement-suite/) (which I help develop!) or some awesome home grown system, and look at all of the different queues.  These queues are all arbitrary filtered lists.  The actually items in the list could include bugs, new features, documentation requests or a vast array of other tasks and assigned to different components of the system you are building.  The important part to remember is that the filters can be changed.

Normally I would work off of a listing by priority with the highest priority first.  I started with the P1 items downy to the P4 items.  The actually content of the item did not matter to me.  My day contained a mix of issues, stories, support requests and documentation all against different area of the product.  I thought this is how I was supposed to work.  

This is how I had always worked.  No one told me how to work, if this what they really wanted me to produce.  I assumed this was the most effective use of my time without really analyzing what I was producing or asking the product manager how he really wanted me to deliver.

### Figuring out what to Change

Since readying The 4-Hour Work Week then subsequent other books, blogs and podcasts; I reevaluated how I was working.  Was I really being efficient.  Was there a better way?

I stared to analyze what was really in these queues I was working from.  What were the similarities and differences?  What did I like working on and what was most frustrating?  Could I element or automate any of it?  What is really expected of me to deliver?

After some self-reflection and discussion with my product manager, I came up with the following answers.

* What were the similarities and differences?
    * Types of requests (issue, story, support request, documentation)
    * Component of System
* What did I like working on and what was most frustrating?
    * I enjoyed new features and some issues.
    * I dreaded support requests and documentation
* Could I element or automate any of it?
    * I can automate using [CloudSpokes](http://www.cloudspokes.com/), my company's crowd sourcing solution.
* What is really expected of me to deliver?
    * We have monthly sprints.  As long as all of the stories and issues assigned during that sprint were complete before code freeze all was right with the world.
    
The last point is probably one of the most important.  I found out the expectation was just to deliver it all by a deadline and not work issues in order.  There was the occasional expect ion where needed to do a off cycle release which required a shuffle in my priorities but that was the exception and not the rule.  I found out I am blessed to have a manager and product manager that doesn't micro manage when and how I complete my work as long as it gets done.  It was a very liberating feeling.

### The new system

With this new information in hand, I went about reorganizing when I work on my requests.  I batched together requests are similar components and was purposeful about which type of request I worked.  I also changed how I approached a request.
