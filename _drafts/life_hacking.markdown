excerpt: The adventure of my Life Hacking

A few weeks ago I finished The [4-Hour Work Week](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357) by [Tim Ferriss](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/).  First off, if you haven't read the book, bookmark this blog post and go read it!

This is the beginning of my chronicles implementing some of the concepts in The 4-Hour Work Week along with other [Life Hacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_hacking) that I have picked up from various sources.  I will do everything I can to credit the original author of the idea.

If you still haven't read Tim's book (shame on you) then here is the 10,000 foot view.  He uses the acronym DEAL which stands for **D**efinition, **E**limination, **A**utomation and **L**iberation.  He does into detail about each of these steps, how they apply to normal 9 - 5 office works or to an entrepreneur.  This book is not an exact step by step guide about how to get rich.  Tim is very clear in saying some part of the book will apply to you and others will not.  So read it all, take it under consideration, apply what you can now and save the rest for later.

I'm currently quite happy at my job.  I can work from home if I want or I can go into the office to socialize (or play ping pong).  I can work when I want as long as I'm producing results.  I'm already way ahead of the average office work.  I still see wonder applications in my own life.

The first few days I've applied his email rule of only checking 2 - 3 times a day.  I went on an information fast; no Facebook, twitter, news sites or news radio (I'm a huge NPR fan).  These few items have lead to a huge increase in time. I've been able to focus on getting my critical path items finished.  In just 2 weeks, I'm able to spend more time with my family, workout everyday and generally be happier while still producing at a high level.  

So this is the first post of many.  I want to keep my self accountable and on track along with sharing the tools I've used to help me apply the DEAL principals from The 4-Hours Work Week.  I plan to post often!

Finally, I knew he will never read my blog, but a special thanks to Tim Ferriss.  Thanks for helping me get my head out of my ass, now it's my job to keep it out!
