<p style="text-align: left;">It's that time of the year again.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.indyrestaurantweek.com/winterfest/index.htm" target="_blank">Devour Downtown</a> is on.&nbsp; For those of you who don't know, this features several restaurants in downtown Indianapolis on a $30 meal.&nbsp; Several of my friends and family refer it to as "30 dollar meal week."&nbsp; In fact, the event lasts 2 weeks but I love them anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of my most difficult decisions is selecting which restaurant I want to go to.&nbsp; Since it also falls on my Birthday week, I get to enjoy a fine dinner on my Birthday for a great price.&nbsp; While I was reading one of my favorite blogs, <a href="http://feedmedrinkme.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Feed Me Drink Me</a> (If you want to know anything about food in Indianapolis, this is the place to start), I came across 2 posts about this years event. (<a href="http://feedmedrinkme.blogspot.com/2009/01/devour-downtown-starts-today.html" target="_blank">Devour Downtown Starts Today</a> and <a href="http://feedmedrinkme.blogspot.com/2009/01/open-thread-devour-downtown-fatique.html" target="_blank">Open Thread: Devour-Downtown Fatique</a>)&nbsp; It really made me think more about my decision.&nbsp; I guess I always assumed the deals were good.&nbsp; Apparently some of them may not be.&nbsp; I will be paying attention to the second thread mentioned for suggestions.&nbsp; I want to make this year great.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I really really want to go to Elements.&nbsp; They don't have a predefined menu though.&nbsp; Which is what I love about them.&nbsp; The menu changes based upon what they have to cook with.&nbsp; The problem is that I have family members with food allergies and have to be careful.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Where would you good?</p>
