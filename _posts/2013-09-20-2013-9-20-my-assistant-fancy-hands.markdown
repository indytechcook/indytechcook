excerpt: Using a Virtual Assistant is easier then you think.
---

The most controversial parts of the 4-Hour Work Week are in the automation section. Tim starts off the automation part of his book by telling you to hire a [virtual personal assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant). He doesn't target this advice to the busiest business people; he tells everyone to get a VPA. The argument is two fold: increase your productivity and learn how to delegate. Both of these are key integral in increasing efficiency. 

I was a bit skeptical. The question everyone (include myself) asks is "why do *I* need a personal assistant?" Tim talks a lot about why in his book. [Here is a sneak peak article](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/outsourcing-life/). I think Tim says it best with this quote: 

> Because the goal is to free your time to focus on bigger and better things.
 
If you have followed the advice I gave in [defining your goals]((http://indytechcook.com/d-definition) then you should be eager to free up time to work toward fulfilling these goals. 

So here is how I have started the journey using a virtual assistant. 

### Finding my virtual assistant 

When I first started hunt for a virtual assistant, I started with the Tim's suggestions of [Brickwork](http://www.brickworkindia.com) and [Your Man in India](http://www.yourmaninindia.com). These seemed very capable but not exactly where I wanted to start. I was a little intimidated by their size and websites. Later, I was reading a blog post (I can't remember from who, I'm so sorry) about using [Fancy Hands](http://fncy.it/14IJW5M) and [IfThisThenThat](http://ifttt.com). I've written about using itfff to send me text messages on important emails so I won't go much more into that tool now. This post is about my experience with a virtual assistant. 

So I signed up for a month, and as it turned out, I had half off since I used a referral (though I don't know for who). Guess what, [follow this link and you can have half off your first month also](http://fncy.it/14IJW5M). This puts the first month at $12.50 for 5 requests. This is a great deal, especially when you see what they have done for me so far. 

### Using my virtual assistant, Fancy Hands 

Let's walk through the requests I made, the outcomes, and my lessons learned. 

#### Request #1: Create a Plan to learn the Java Programming Language 

> I'm super excited to use Fancy Hands and I want to thank you advance in what I know will be a fantastic result! 
> 
> I started a new job where I need to learn how to program in Java. I already have years of programming experience in PHP and architected very large complicated websites. This means I'm not starting from scratch in programming or in Object Oriented Programming. I'm not looking for a "how to program for dummies", I'm looking for a solid plan to help me become very effective as quickly as possible. 
> 
> Here is what must be covered 
> 
> Learn Java 
> Learn Spring (http://fncy.it/19j1VT3 (springsource.org) 
> Learn Java/Spring Patterns 
> Acceptable learning medium 
> 
> Books 
> Videos 
> Online course/self paced 
> Blog Posts 
> NO IN PERSON TRAINING unless it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. They are slow and boring! 
> 
> Possible Deliverables: 
> 
> An ordered list of what I should do to become awesome and why they you think they will make me awesome. 
> A few options to learn in the three areas (Java, Spring, Patterns) and why you think they will make me awesome. 
> Don't worry too much about cost, they will be exposed. 

So this first request was a little vague and the response I got matched what I requested. The problem is what I really wanted wasn't what I requested. I actually made the job too easy on Fancy Hands. The response was pretty long, so I won't post it, but it was basically a list of links (which is what I stated) and I really wanted a plan. 

Lesson Learned. 

#### Request #2: Does my insurance cover Chiropractor or Acupuncture 

> My lower back is killing me! Does my insurance cover Chiropractic or Acupuncture? 
> 
> If so which ones are the highest rated and closest to me? zip code: 46143 
> 
> The screenshots of my health card is in the evernote called "Insurance Card Screenshots". That has been shared in the Fancy Hands folder so you should be able to see it. 
> 
> I'm not sure what information they would need from me, feel free to patch me into a phone call if needed. My calendar is linked to this account so you can see my availability. 

[Fancy Hands](http://fncy.it/14IJW5M) has some cool integrations including Google Calendar and [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=1274944&sig=cd033a6fe7c43055bf73fd8488416cfa). I took pictures of my insurance card (front and back), uploaded them to [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=1274944&sig=cd033a6fe7c43055bf73fd8488416cfa), and sent them on their way. 

This request was a little more specific but open ended. I delegated one of the most dreaded tasks known to manâ€¦.calling the insurance company. The results were fantastic. I avoided a 45 min call! That was worth the $15 alone (hint, [go sign up](http://fncy.it/14IJW5M)). Not to mention that the results were good. I received three chiropractors and one acupuncturist along with phone number and a link to information about the providers on my insurance's website. 

#### Request #3: Research Chiropractor 

> You did an awesome job in the last request finding these Chiropractors. Now I need to know which one to checkout! 
> 
> Please give me a short summary of each of these chiropractors including the following information: 
> 
> Reviews 
> Referrals from customers 
> Any Health grades 
> Website Links 
> Prices 
> Which would you use? 
> 
> *Details hidden for privacy reasons*

This request was a follow up from Request #2. This request was very well formatted. I asked for specific information about specific people but left some room for some opinion to make the Fancy Hands request fulfiller fill involved in the success of the request with me. 

The results were again wonderful. I received detailed information about the doctors I asked about, the rates they charge, and found some reviews online. They even found out who was actively taking patients. This step showed anticipation of my future needs. I was very impressed. 

The request saved me six phone calls and some phone tag also. The request itself took a little longer then the previous one due to the number of phone calls, but it was still within two days, which is very acceptable. 

#### Request #4: Schedule appointment with Chiropractor 

> You did such a great job with finding the chiropractor now please schedule an appointment with a chiropractor. Please add the appointment to my calendar allowing for a 1 hour buffer around the visit. 
> 
> *Details hidden*

Since I had my Google Calendar hooked up, [Fancy Hands](http://fncy.it/14IJW5M) was able to schedule my appointment with no interaction from me. This was really exciting and the first time someone has scheduled an appointment for me. I felt like I was really important. 

Scheduling this appointment actually took three phone calls back and forth. This saved me the headache of more phone tag. Then, just to be nice, they emailed my wife with when my appointment was and added it to her Google Calendar! 

I did forget one detail about this request. IT WAS FREE!!! That's right, it didn't count against my five requests. Scheduling appointments is free with [Fancy Hands](http://fncy.it/14IJW5M). That is fantastic and I'm going to use that again. 

### What I would improve

[Fancy hand](http://fncy.it/14IJW5M) is great if you want to mange your own tasks.  I do feel a little separation between tasks.  The other companies are a more traditional personal assistant setup where you deal they know everything about you and take care of you.  I hope to graduate to those services eventually but [Fancy Hands](http://fncy.it/14IJW5M) is a great start.

### Summary 

This experience turned out to be a huge success. When I started using [Fancy Hands](http://fncy.it/14IJW5M), my wife was really skeptical. After I shared the story of the chiropractor, she asked me if she could use one of the tasks to gather some insurance information. To understand the gauge of her asking this, you need to have some background. In conversations, she has said she would rather spend the 45 minutes on the phone then pay someone else $15 to do it for her. I think she was just skeptical that we could really have someone do it for us. Now she has seen the results, I hope to expand both of our uses of [Fancy Hands](http://fncy.it/14IJW5M) to automate and delegate more aspects of our life.
