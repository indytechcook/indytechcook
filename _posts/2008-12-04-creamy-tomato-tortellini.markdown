My fie is back in town which mean I get to cook again.&nbsp; It isn't any fun cooking for myself.&nbsp; Since she is still pregnant, I have to have all dishes approved.&nbsp; She selected a <a href="http://techcook.s3.amazonaws.com/creamy_tom_tor.jpg" target="_blank">Creamy Tomato Tortellini</a>.&nbsp; It's a very simple dish that takes 20 minutes form gathering ingredients to the plate.&nbsp; It's not the best tasting dish but it's simple and good.&nbsp; I have this recipe on my <a href="http://www.tastebook.com/" target="_blank">TasteBook</a> site.
