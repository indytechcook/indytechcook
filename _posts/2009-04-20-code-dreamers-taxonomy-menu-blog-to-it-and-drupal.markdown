<p style="text-align: left;">It's been a while since I've posted and I've been very busy.&nbsp; I launched a new consulting service I call <a href="http://code-dreamers.com" target="_blank">Code Dreamers</a>.&nbsp; I've spent tons of time on <a href="http://drupal.org/project/taxonomy_menu" target="_blank">Taxonomy Menu</a> and started to develop my ideas for <a href="http://blog.to.it/" target="_blank">Blog to It</a>.&nbsp; Drupal has began to take over my life and I'm loving it.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Code Dreamers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A few months ago I launch the official front end to my freelancer Drupal development.&nbsp; After much consideration, I named it Code Dreamers (http://code-dreamers.com).&nbsp; Since I'm not a full time developer, I've done my best to limit my scope of what services I offer.&nbsp; With a child on the way, I didn't want to get myself anymore over extended then I already am.&nbsp; I've deiced to specialize in offering custom Drupal functionality.&nbsp; I'm not looking to create the entire site, just add or enhance a current site/project.&nbsp; My clients are other developers and designers (mostly designers).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is a very excited endeavor for me.&nbsp; Hopefully the start of a new life in development.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Taxonomy Menu</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This module has consumed most of my free time.&nbsp; I totally rewrote the module to use Drupal's menu system correctly.&nbsp; I've learned a ton about Drupal, php and open source development.&nbsp; I am very proud of this module.&nbsp; I have spent countless hours in the issues queue answer questions and developing new functionality.&nbsp; A few other developers had submitted patches to enhance it's functionality.&nbsp; It's great to get more involvement.&nbsp; One of the featuers I'm most proudof is the API (http://drupal.org/node/380652).&nbsp; Now developers can customized the menu to their hearts content.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm working on the next version of Taxonomy Menu already.&nbsp; Some great ideas are coming form the community.&nbsp; It will be easier to use with more customization.&nbsp; I'm very excited about this.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it's slow coming.&nbsp; I hope to have a first alpha version by the end of the month.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Blog To It</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had several conversation with the developer of Blog To It (http://blog.to.it), Tim Millwood (http://www.millwoodonline.co.uk/) over Twitter and we ended up teaming up to work on the site together.&nbsp; He launched Blog To It shortly after I began working on Blogs of Indy.&nbsp; I've decided to stop development on Blogs of Indy and focus on Blog to It instead.&nbsp; Tim and I have had tossed around ideas and I'm ready to get started.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Drupal</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have began to implement new Drupal sites at my place of employment.&nbsp; They have been a M$ shop for a long time and the idea of open source is very scary.&nbsp; Their attitude changed very quickly when I was able to create a server and deploy a custom fully functionality website within 20 hours.&nbsp; Now I'm adding more Drupal sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm hoping to make my full time job developing Drupal.</p>
