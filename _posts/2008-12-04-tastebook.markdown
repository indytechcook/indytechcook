Being that I like technology and cooking, i had to find a good way to marry them.&nbsp; The site <a href="http://www.tastebook.com" target="_blank">http://www.tastebook.com</a> does a great job of this.&nbsp; This site is a great tool for anyone looking for recipes.&nbsp; The interface is beutiflly using AJAX techniques that even a web designer can appreciate.&nbsp; It is very easy to search 100,000+ recipies and save them to your book.&nbsp; If you have friends on the site, then you can share the recipies with them also.&nbsp; I've tried several different recipe sites but none of them compare to this one.&nbsp; The ability to search all of the other recipie sites is a key feature.&nbsp; The search feature is very versitile allowing you to search by type of meal or ingrdeants.&nbsp; Have extra turkey sitting arround?&nbsp; just select turkey as and see what fun things you can cook!&nbsp; And yes, you can add your own recipies.&nbsp; If you like cooking, then I recommend you try this site.&nbsp; Look me up to.&nbsp; I'd be happy to share what I have.
