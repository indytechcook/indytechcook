<p style="text-align: left;">Apparently Google indexed the bogsofndy.com site and notified a few of the blog owners that their content was being published.&nbsp; This was unfortunate because they saw the site before it was ready.&nbsp; After a few email discussions they were on board with my idea.&nbsp; I was also able to pull some good suggestions.&nbsp; I now understand how passionate many bloggers are about their content.&nbsp; This has lead me to add some features that will benefit the bloggers.</p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li>Control over how the content will be displayed:&nbsp; Using Drupal's input formats, I can specify what HTML tags are allowed.&nbsp; So if they do not want their pictures to appear then they won't.</li>
	<li>Display Teaser Only:&nbsp; This will only display a teaser of the post on Blogs of Indy.&nbsp; This option is only available if they are using a plain text input format.</li>
	<li>More Blocks.
<ul>
	<li>"Most posts from this Author"</li>
	<li>"About this Author"</li>
	<li>"Post from this category"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hopefully most of the blog owners will allow the full post to be displayed if I have a strong presence showing who the content is from.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I've also changed my philosophy on how the categories and tags will be managed.&nbsp; Instead of having the categories managed by an administrator, the users will be able to categorize the content if they do not agree.&nbsp; The will not be able to remove a post from a category, but rather add it to a category.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Blogs of Indy is going to be focused around dipalying the most relevant information for the reader.&nbsp; I have ideas of adding a "Other posts you would like" sort of block in the future.</p>
