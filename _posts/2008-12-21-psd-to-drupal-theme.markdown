<p style="text-align: left;">I found a very interesting resource that coverts a psd file to a Drupal theme.&nbsp; psdtocss (http://psd2cssonline.com/) online claims to accomplish this from their website.

Example site:
http://newfind.net/DrupalTheme/

Here are a few screencasts from the created.

It creates the regions based upon the of the layer.&nbsp; So if you want to add a search region, you just create a layer called mysearch_drupal.&nbsp; You set the size and location of the layer to the size you want for the region and this site will create the .info, .tpl and .css files for the psd.&nbsp; This is a great way to start the your theme.&nbsp; It's not perfect, it seems to use fixed width and height but that can be changed via css.

I haven't tried this out yet but I will be soon.
