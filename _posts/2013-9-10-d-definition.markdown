excerpt: Defining your goals is what makes all of the hard work worth the time.
---

This is the post I have been putting off.  Implementing a few of the concepts from the 4 Hour Work Week was easy.  But I skipped a step.  The most important step.  Defining why I was eliminating and automating.  I skipped it because it's hard.  Really hard.

### The Problem

After I implemented a [daily schedule](http://indytechcook.com/being-purposeful) (which I'm not consistently following) and [reduced the constant checking of my email](http://indytechcook.com/email-processing), I found that I had a lot of free time.  I didn't know what to do with this extra time I ended up resorting to non-value adding tasks.  I binged watched Netflix (this is what I call watching most of a season in one day) and surfed the internet more.  I really started to not like what I was doing.  It and only been 2 weeks and I was already getting bored with the extra time.  This was because I failed to define anything to fill the extra time. So here I go, defining what my goals are to fill the extra time.  Time to add real value to my life. 

### How to Define

Before I decide what to define, how should I define it.  Yes, this might be another stall tactic but I do think it's important to think about what types of goals.  The Four Hour Work Week does a good job in helping guide you in this area.  Let's review some pointers.

There are several ways to define your goals but let's stick with [Tim's method](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/4-hour-workweek-tools/#chap4).  He calls it "Dreamlining"  These are all themes I pulled from The Four Hour Work Week's Define chapter.  These are just high level, you can find much more detail from his book.

* Make the goals big
* Keep the timelines short
* Don't judge or fool yourself

##### Definition Steps

1. Make goals in the following areas (in order)
    1. **having** (including but limited to material items)
    2. **being**
    3. **doing**
3. Convert Being into Doing
4. Select four dreams from the initial list.  These are the most important and most exciting.
5. Determine the Cost of the Dream.

### My Definition

Here we go, the reason for this post and what should send me on a more directional path through life.  Let's hope that I'm not blowing this out of proportion.

#### Who I want to be

In thinking about these goals, I not only want to design the lifestyle I want, but the person I want to become.  This person's primary goal in life is to love an serve others.  In serving others, I must also serve myself because turning me into a better tool can only benefit others.  It's not selfish to feel that making yourself better can make other better also. I strongly believe that serving others will lead to my ultimate life design.

#### Possible Goals

**Having**

* New Custom House - 12 months
* New Look/Style - 12 months
* Cleaning Service - 6 months
* Promotion - 12 months
* A mentor - 6 months

    * Doing: Cook Dinner twice a week 

**Doing**

* Have a monthly lunch with someone I admire - 6 months
* Win a weight lifting competition - 12 months
* Teach my daughter to Read - 12 months

### Follow my Progress

I really want to go into detail about each of these goals, what they mean, why I choose them and how I plan on achieving them but that is a blog post per goal.  I'm going to start by using [workflowy](https://workflowy.com/?ref=cc89f9d) to share [my progress on each step](https://workflowy.com/shared/3d0efacd-b6ca-4a2d-41a4-c4c154975653/).  I'll also blog more about details for each goal, the progress and the thought behind them.

### Why?

I do not expect anyone to read these blog posts.  I'm writing them for me.  But just in case someone does read this (or I forget why I did them), here is why.

**I believe in transparency.**  We should be able to share and discuss our thoughts, dreams and ideas in a public forum with out being ridiculed.  Sharing should enhance our lives and make us all better people.  

**I need accountability.**  I really want to be a better person but I have a hard time focusing.  Writing out what I have done and my thoughts will help me keep in target and honest.  It's easy to catch me lying to myself when it's as public as the internet.

**I want to make others better.**  I strive for continually self-improvement.  At any given time I am the worst version of myself and I really look forward to being a better version.  This means I'm always focused on the future.  To many people struggle through life and if documenting my journeys can lead them to a  better life then I know it's worth it.

### Share with me

I want to hear from anyone reading this.  Do you like it?  Do you hate it?  What would you improve?  How would this be more useful to you?
