<p style="text-align: left;">So I've done it.&nbsp; My first contributed module.&nbsp; I'm not say it's good or going to change they way you use Drupal but it's useful for me.&nbsp; Since I've been working on my RSS aggregate site www.blogsofindy.com, I have needed more control over how the feeds are being pulled in.&nbsp; I put together this module to give me more control over Taxonomy.&nbsp; If you use FeedAPI check it out and give me your thoughts.</p>
