I tried a new recipe tonight.&nbsp; Chicken and Rice.&nbsp; I enjoy cooking skillet based meals.&nbsp; It makes me feel like I could be a real chef.&nbsp; <a href="http://techcook.s3.amazonaws.com/Chicken and Rice.jpg" target="_blank">Link to Recipe</a>.

It started off easy enough, cooking chicken in oil.&nbsp; I use canola oil rather then vegetable oil.&nbsp; The chicken doesn't cook the entire way at this stage.&nbsp; Browning is all that is required.

The next step is to remove the chicken and add all of the other ingredients to pan to boil.

I recommend adding the rice first and letting that boil covered for a few minutes.&nbsp; Our rice was a little under done.

After boiling the Rice add the broccoli and it should look like the picture to the right.

Stir mixture then add back the chicken.&nbsp; Next just turn down the heat and let the chicken finish cooking.&nbsp; Another 10 minutes should do it.&nbsp; Now is a good time to clean up the mess that was created and put away the ingredients.&nbsp; I look for recipes that have a simmer time, I hate spending another 30 minutes cleaning after I eat.

The finished produce is a color and taste full treat.&nbsp; Another quick and easy meal.

Lessons Learned:&nbsp; Steam Rice Longer.&nbsp; Add more seasoning.
