If you read my post from last [Monday's goal update](http://indytechcook.com/goal-update-9-30/), you would see that I have a goal to lose 20 lbs in 6 months and keep it off for 6 months.  I feel this would help establish a consistent behavior of healthy eating and working out.

I noticed that I'm having issues staying motivated to keep working on my goals so I'm coming up with some systems to keep me moving.  This is my system to keep me working out and eating healthy.  I'm really excited about the setup I have an wanted to share my system with you.

### Tools

My current process involves a few tools to help track and motivate me.

* [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com/user/278SWS): I use the [Fitbit Flex Tracker](http://www.fitbit.com/flex) to monitor my actually activity and sleep patterns.  This is a more accurate reading then just estimate calorie usage.
* [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/indytechcook):  MyFitnessPal is an excellent tool to track you daily log of food and exercise that the FitBit doesn't log well.  For example weight lifting, push ups, sit ups.  MyFitnessPal and FitBit are able to communicate with each other to update each system.  If you setup the syncing be sure to go to your settings page ([http://www.myfitnesspal.com/account/diary_settings](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/account/diary_settings)) and select "Enable Negative Adjustments" setting.  This will give you a true look at how many calories you are burning.  I found out I wasn't doing nearly as well as I thought I was when I actually let the real data show through.
* [EveryMove](http://everymove.org):  This is a really cool app.  It gives you rewards for working out.  The steps you take with the Fitbit and the exercise you enter in MyFitnessPal all make there way to EveryMove.  There is also integration with a host of other apps and devices including RunKeeper, Jawbone Up and Nike+.  If you link to Facebook or FourSquare, you can receive points for checking into a gym.  Best of all the rewards are real and obtainable.  I received my first one with 2 weeks worth of work (and I didn't even workout last week).
* [TicTrac](http://www.tictrac.com):  TicTrac is quite a bit different.  It's focused on gather data from several sources to give you a big picture view of what's going on in your life.  It's more then just working out, it also looks at stress levels, Facebook and Twitter.  It's really innovative and enjoyable to use but not really as useful in my day to day life as the other tools.

To help visualize what the interaction between the system looks like, I came up with this lovely chart.
