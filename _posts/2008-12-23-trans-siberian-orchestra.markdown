<p style="text-align: left;">This post is going to be a little off topic.&nbsp; Last night my wife and I went to the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.&nbsp; Having never been there before I wasn't sure what to expect.&nbsp; The name "Orchestra" is very misleading.&nbsp; It's more like a Christmas rock concert. I was very impressed.&nbsp; The effects were very cool.&nbsp; Check out the pictures below.</p>
