These updates are from the [D for Definition](http://indytechcook.com/d-definition/) post.  If you haven't read that post please do!


### Goal:  New House

Continuing Passive Income Streams.  I just submitted a very large invoice for my freelancing work.

### Goal:  Write a book

No update.  I've been focusing on other areas.

### Goal: Lose 20 lbs in 6 months and key it off for 6 months.

I feel that focusing this goal on weight loss has really help me to stay on track.  I wrote about my system for staying motivated and how I will measure my progress here:  http://indytechcook.com/how-i-keep-motivated-to-workout.

I've lost 1 lb so far.  Check up on me here:  http://www.myfitnesspal.com/indytechcook.


### Goal: Teach my daughter to read

We are having some issues getting her to recognize all of her letters consistantly.  Sometimes she seems to know all of them, other times she just seems to not want to even try.  I'm not discouraged, I know it takes time and it makes her tired so we keep our sessions short and focused.

### Goal: Have a monthly lunch with someone I admire

Great progress!  I had lunch with 2 people this past week.   Both of which I reconnected with after a long absence.   I'm going to setup another meeting for either next week or the week after! 

### Attend social events more regularly

This is going to be removed, more about what and what replaces it will come tomorrow.

### Cook Dinner twice a week

I did help with dinner a few times but it wasn't really cooking, just heating stuff up.  Though any little bit will help my wife since this goal is about providing more time for my wife.  I did receive a $35 gift card to [http://www.hellofresh.com/](http://www.hellofresh.com/) via [http://everymove.org](http://everymove.org) so I'll try that out here in a few weeks.  It will be a good experience win seeing how effectiveness of sourcing meal planing.

### Until Next timeâ€¦

Last week was about getting the ball moving again.  I made progress on a few goals and started to set myself up to tackle a few more goals in the next few weeks.  I move away from spending time on getting organized and refocused on getting something done.  Just one task at a time is really helping.

As always, I look forward to your comments!
