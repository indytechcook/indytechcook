I have always been a fan of everything local.&nbsp; Whether you are talking about food or stores, I make every attempt to go local first.&nbsp; In this spirit, I am putting together a site to syndicate local blogs.

The site will be based upon drupal.&nbsp; In the first release, users will be able to create account and select favorite categories.&nbsp; All blogs of the selected categories will be placed on the users home page.&nbsp; The user will also have the option to receive daily updates via email of their selected categories.

I will a add more entires as the site progresses and become live.&nbsp; I am very excited about this project and hope that others will enjoy the free service.
