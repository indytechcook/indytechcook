excerpt: Batter life is key!

My best advice to enhancing the power in the battery on your Mac Book Pro is to turn down the screen brightness.  I've worked in coffee shops for years and power isn't always available.  Turning down the screen brightness can literally add hours to your work time.

This might be a bad thing if you are trying to time box your work.  In that case, just turn the screen brightness all the way up and push that battery to it's limits!
