<p style="text-align: left;">I have been tasked by my favorite boss (my wife) to cook Christmas breakfast.&nbsp; This year my family is celebrating Christmas at my house.&nbsp; Wilie some people might see this as a burden, I see it as a blessing.&nbsp; There isn't much I enjoy more then spending quality time with my family.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My wife gave me a recipe from <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Food Network</a> (my favorite) for <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/classic-belgian-waffles-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Classic Belgian Waffles</a> from <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/emeril-lagasse/index.html" target="_blank">Chef Emeril</a> (BAM).&nbsp; This is not your make from a box waffle.&nbsp; I feel this is a very big step for her.&nbsp; This is the first time she has encouraged me to make something from scratch that would just as easily be made from a kit.&nbsp; While this encouragement is subtle (I don't she even knew she did it) it still means a lot to me.&nbsp; I have shared several ideas with her over the years.&nbsp; Most of them never turned into anything, just ideas.&nbsp; This encouragement will help me stick with cooking.&nbsp; It truly is something that I enjoy that can benefit others.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe I will be more talented at cooking then at computers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This recipe sure does use a lot of dishes!&nbsp; Being the person who does all of the dishes in the house this is something I notice.&nbsp; The recipe on the site is one big long paragraph.&nbsp; I split it up a little here to make it easier to follow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Read through the recipe and see my comments at the end.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Ingredients</h3>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li>2 cups cake flour</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>4 large eggs, separated</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
	<li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
	<li>2 cups milk</li>
	<li>non-stick cooking spray</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Directions</h3>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li>Preheat the waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
	<li>In 1 medium bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
	<li>In a second bowl use the wooden spoon to beat together the egg yolks and sugar until sugar is completely dissolved and eggs have turned a pale yellow. Add the vanilla extract, melted butter, and milk to the eggs and whisk to combine.</li>
	<li>Combine the egg-milk mixture with the flour mixture and whisk just until blended. <strong>Do not over mix.</strong></li>
	<li>In third bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks form, about 1 minute.</li>
	<li>Using the rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the waffle batter. <strong>Do not overmix! </strong></li>
	<li>Coat the waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray and pour enough batter in iron to just cover waffle grid.</li>
	<li>Close and cook as per manufacturer's instructions until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
	<li>Serve immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Analysis</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">First of all, it always scares me when a recipe tells me to not do something.&nbsp; Normally I end up over compensating.&nbsp; Before I even start the direction there is gong to be some prep work.&nbsp; I like to have the ingredients pre-measured so it does not mess up my timing while I am cooking.&nbsp; In this case there is one more prep step:&nbsp; I will need to have 2 more bowls to separate the eggs.&nbsp; Great, more dishes.&nbsp; The rest of the recipe doesn't sound to bad.&nbsp; It was rated as a "easy" recipe.&nbsp; We will see.&nbsp; I will be sure to document my cooking experience and add a post.</p>
