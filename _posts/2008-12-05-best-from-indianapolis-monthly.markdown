Indianapolis Monty came out there their best of 2008 list.&nbsp; Especially interesting to is the page for <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/articleNew.aspx?id=52230&amp;page=2" target="_blank">Best Food and Drink.</a> It's always interesting to read other peoples opions on food.&nbsp; Looking through this list, I have only been to one of the restauruants.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.goosethemarket.com/" target="_blank">Goose the Market</a>.&nbsp; I have to agree that they have the best sandwitches I've ever had.&nbsp; Not only do they taste good, they have a strong neighboorhood pride of providing goods.&nbsp; I try to make it there at least once a week.
