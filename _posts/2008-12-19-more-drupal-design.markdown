<p style="text-align: left;">I have more desgin Details about blogs of Indy (my first <a href="http://drupal.org" target="_blank">Druapl</a> site).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I want a login block like <a href="http://geeksandgod.com/" target="_blank">Geeds and God</a>.&nbsp; The content of the block will change depending on if a user is logged in.&nbsp; The Ajax interface allows for a smooth transition to the log in dialog.&nbsp; I haven't selected an exact color scheme yet but I created <a href="http://techcook.s3.amazonaws.com/indyblog_logo.gif" target="_parent">this logo</a>.&nbsp; I like the dark blue but I want a very light a clean site.&nbsp; I plan on using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/viewscarousel" target="_blank">Views Carousel</a> to have a list of the site news and the feeds at the bottem of the page.&nbsp; My goal is to make it easy for the user to get to the content.&nbsp; A narrow header with the logo on the right and a list of the categories (with drop downs) on the left.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Current to do list:</p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li>Subscribe Block</li>
	<li>Login Ajax/jQuery block</li>
	<li>Install/Confiure Views Carousel</li>
	<li>Fun with Themes (I may go external for this one)</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">***** UPDATE ****</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">So I was in the shower this morning and I had found a problem with this design.&nbsp; There is potential going to be a lot of content on the page so having blocks in the footer is not a good idea.&nbsp; I'm going to have to find a way to eithe put something in the header or use one of the sidebars.&nbsp; The question is how fancy do I want to get?&nbsp; Thoughts of pretty java script are running through my head but I am reminned of my design philosphy of K.I.S.S. (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">K</span>eep <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span>t <span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span>imple, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span>tupid.).&nbsp; It may be time to enlist some professional help...</p>
