<p style="text-align: left;">I posted <a href="http://techcook.net/2008/12/christmas-breakfast/" target="_blank">this</a> earlier about how I was responsible for Christmas breakfast at my house for 12 people (13 if you count the 3 month old).&nbsp; The house was a zoo.&nbsp; I doubled the recipe and it was the perfect amount.&nbsp; My wife also put together a fresh fruit said (bananas, grapes, canned pineapples, honey crisp apples, orange, and blueberries).&nbsp; It was a good compliment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I did my best to get a picture of people enjoying the food, but each batch of waffles that came out of the iron were gone within minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I must say these were the best waffles that I had ever had.&nbsp; So light and fluffy that you could eat 10 of them.&nbsp; Of course it helps that I only have a small waffle maker that makes the little 4x4 inch waffles.&nbsp; It did take me about an hour to prep these.&nbsp; I ended up missing some of the present opening.&nbsp; So here are some tips to help you avoid that.</p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li>PREP, PREP, PREP!</li>
	<li>Have all of the dry ingredients premixed.</li>
	<li>Create the egg yoke mixture (egg yokes and sugar).</li>
	<li>Pre-Beat the egg whites.&nbsp; I'm not sure how early you can do this one.&nbsp; A side note that it took atleast 8 minutes of beating with a handheld electric mixture to get the correct consistency and we don't think we beat them enough.</li>
	<li>Don't over spray your iron.&nbsp; Depending on your iron, there is such a thing as to much cooking spray.&nbsp; I found reapplying every 3rd attempt kept my iron good and clean while not transferring to much of the oil to the waffles and hindering the backing process.</li>
	<li>Server quickly.&nbsp; They get cold fast.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Following the prep steps will go a long way on&nbsp; cooking day.&nbsp; Especially if you are cooking for 12!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Merry Christmas and Happy Cooking!!</strong></p>
