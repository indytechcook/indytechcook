<p style="text-align: left;">Over the past few years my php development was rare and disconnected.&nbsp; <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> fit all of my needs.&nbsp; It has a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=189927&amp;package_id=236520" target="_blank">debugger plugin</a> and some <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=189927&amp;package_id=223668" target="_blank">syntax highlighting</a>.&nbsp; Now that I am becoming a free lance developer I needed a more full feature IDE.&nbsp; Most of my development will be for custom <a href="http://drupal.org/" target="_parent">Drupal</a> modules.&nbsp; I did a little google search and found a few good comparison sites.&nbsp; One from<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-php-ide/index.html" target="_blank"> IBM</a> and another from <a href="http://www.php-editors.com/" target="_parent">PHP Editors</a> ( a note that this site seems to be sponsored by NuSphere PhpED).</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">My needs</h3>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li>Syntax color coding</li>
	<li>Tab Formatting help</li>
	<li>Auto Complete</li>
	<li>Ability to add folders as includes for auto complete.</li>
	<li>Debugging</li>
	<li>CVS/SVN integration</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are the IDE's that I tested.</p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li><a href="http://www.zend.com/en/products/studio/" target="_blank">Zend Studio</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.nusphere.com/products/index.htm" target="_blank">NuSphere PhpED</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo/" target="_blank">Komodo</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.codelobster.com/" target="_blank">Code Lobster</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.netbeans.org/" target="_blank">NetBeans</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.zend.com/en/products/studio/" target="_blank">Zend Studio</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Zend Studio is a very well polished product.&nbsp; It has every tool you would every want in an IDE.&nbsp; That is it's greatest strength and weakness.&nbsp; The entire interface seemed a little sluggish compared to the other IDE's.&nbsp; The interfaced had a more professional look then the others.&nbsp; It was very easy to start using.&nbsp; The controls were very intuitive.&nbsp; You can get started doing basic PHP sites easily and know that there is plenty to learn. &nbsp;&nbsp; So what's the downside?&nbsp; The price.&nbsp; At $399 for 1 year of upgrades and $717 for 3 years it is rather steep.&nbsp; It's a great IDE though.&nbsp; I enjoyed my 30 days using Zend, and it's made by the same people who made PHP.&nbsp; It's a great choice.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nusphere.com/products/index.htm" target="_blank">NuSphere PhpED</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">After all of the hype from the PHP Editors website, I had to give the trial a go.&nbsp; Like Zend this is a full featured IDE.&nbsp; It has every tool you would every need.&nbsp; I didn't spend much time with this IDE.&nbsp; When I tested it I didn't have any projects, I was just researching.&nbsp; It worked well but didn't leave any sort of lasting impression on me.&nbsp; I read that it has excellent debuger and good database integration.&nbsp; It also is a little expense at $250.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo/" target="_blank">Active Stat's Komodo</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">This was a great product.&nbsp; I fell in love with this IDE from the first line of code I wrote.&nbsp; Not only does it contain all of the features that Zend has, it is FAST.&nbsp; I didn't feel like the application was doing anything in the background like Zend.&nbsp; The code intelligence was fast and it added include folders with ease.&nbsp; The debugger worked as well as the other IDE's (they all use the XDebug PHP plugin).&nbsp; The only down side is that the interface didn't look like a $300 application.&nbsp; The developers have definitely spent their time on speed and functionality instead of the presentation.&nbsp; This was my favorite of the paid IDE's.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.codelobster.com/" target="_blank">Code Lobster</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Code Lobster is a new comer to the IDE arena.&nbsp; The product was good and the price was right, FREE!!&nbsp; It has code intelligence and debugging just like the big boys.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was quick and had a nice interface.&nbsp; I was as comfortable doing the actual coding.&nbsp; The tab logic and auto ")" and "}" didn't act like I wanted.&nbsp; I had to go back a few times to edit the "help" it provided.&nbsp; One of the coolest features about Code Lobster is the Drupal plug in.&nbsp; It had full integration to the Drupal API.&nbsp; It even knew how to format the array correctly.&nbsp; If you put "$form['form_name] = array" then the auto complete takes control asking you which element you want to use.&nbsp; You just select them from the drop down and it formats it according to the Drupal standards (even puts the "#").&nbsp; There is also a Smarty Plug in that I'm sure is just as cool.&nbsp; The plug-ins are not free though.&nbsp; But if you are going to use Code Lobster, the $99 plug-in is worth it.&nbsp; That being said, I couldn't pull myself past the coding "help."</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.netbeans.org/" target="_blank">NetBeans</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">NetBeans is free IDE based totally in Java.&nbsp; Alright, don't run for the hills quite yet.&nbsp; This IDE has came a long way during it's life.&nbsp; The newest version is fast and fully featured.&nbsp; The interface and usability is right up there with Zend and Komodo.&nbsp; While it wasn't love at first site, like Komodo, it has turned into a loving relationship.&nbsp; After a little tweaking of the settings, it did everything I wanted how I wanted.&nbsp; It fit my coding habits perfectly.&nbsp; One of the cool features is the debugger.&nbsp; It has the standard XDebug functionality but it also has a firefox plugin to debug the front end.&nbsp; Guess what, It has a <a href="https://nbdrupalsupport.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">Drupal plug-in</a> also.&nbsp; The plug in is not as feature rich as the Code Lobster one but it Free.&nbsp; Oh, and did I mention that everything is FREE!</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">If Komod was free then I would have used that.&nbsp; Being that it wasn't I went to NetBeans.&nbsp; I have no regrats.&nbsp; NetBeans as been very good to me.&nbsp; My effeicncy is way up.&nbsp; No longer to I forget the ";" or have any syntax errors.&nbsp; I am now a happy devloper.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know there are several others that are good that I haven't tried.&nbsp; This is in no way a complete list.&nbsp; Just my experience.</p>
