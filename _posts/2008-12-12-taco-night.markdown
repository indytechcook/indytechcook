So Last night was taco night.&nbsp; Believe it or not, it was my first time making tacos.&nbsp; I'm surprized I haven't tackled them before.&nbsp; I was very surprized how easy it was:&nbsp; Brown Meat, add seasoning and serve.&nbsp; With only two of these we have left overs.&nbsp; Any one want some?
