After 16 hours of charging, I was able to hook up the system.&nbsp; It took about 20 minutes of configuration.&nbsp; It turns out that I atctually purchased 4 phones so I placed one in the kitchen, one in the den, one in the basement and one in the master bedroom.

Next was setting up XLink.&nbsp; This took about 2 minutes.&nbsp; Amazing how easy technology can be.

Of course I'm having a few nonrelated network issues that affect the phone system.&nbsp; My switch (Dell 5324) is having a few issues.&nbsp; I was able to get the network up and connected to the router, but I can not access the web site for the switch to configure it.&nbsp; While this isn't vital at this time.&nbsp; It still needs to be fixed if I need to change any configurations&nbsp; of the swtich.

I plan on doing a write up on my home network setup soon as I am expanding the wiring to the den.
