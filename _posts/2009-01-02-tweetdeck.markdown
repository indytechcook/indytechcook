<p style="text-align: left;">I found a new application today called <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/" target="_blank">TweetDeck.</a> If you user twitter and you have windows, this program is a must.&nbsp; It makes it very easy to keep up to date on the tweets from your computer rather then logging onto the website.&nbsp; The installation was a breeze and you receive real time updates when a tweet comes in.&nbsp; If you receive several hundred a day, then you can filter what you see based upon who it's from, if it is a direct message or if it is a reply.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Check it out!</p>
