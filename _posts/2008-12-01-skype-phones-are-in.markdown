So the GE Skype phones came in.&nbsp; They look good and feel solid.&nbsp; I had read that some people think they feel cheap but I do not share that opion.

Now we wait.&nbsp; 16 hours to charge.&nbsp; Tonight I will update the main adapter and the XLink Gateway to be ready for tomorrow.

I think they look good.&nbsp; What do you think?
