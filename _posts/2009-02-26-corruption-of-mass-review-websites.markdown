<p style="text-align: left;">I read a very interesting article from Braingir's blog <a href="http://feedmedrinkme.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Feed Me Drink Me</a> about a mass review service called <a href="http://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank">Yelp. </a>Yelp is a site where anyone can post a review about a service.&nbsp; The idea is to get reviews from the average person to help another average person make an educated selection.&nbsp; I have used several services like this to search for all sorts of information from where I should go eat to what mechanic should I use.&nbsp; I have always read the views with interest, knowing that one bad experience does not make an establishment poor.&nbsp; You are more likely to find bad reviews over good ones, so when a good one was found I added more weight to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My trust in these sites has now gone by the wayside.&nbsp; From braingir's blog:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Problems first surfaced last year, when the San Francisco Chronicle's <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=26&amp;entry_id=28020">Michael Bauer wrote </a>that a few chefs had encountered diners threatening them with bad reviews if meals and drinks weren't comped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Continued on to this paragraph where all of my faith was lost:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, Michael Atkinson, founder of the social networking site <a href="http://www.fohboh.com/profiles/blog/show?id=1411008%3ABlogPost%3A265524">FOH-BOH, reports</a> even worse shenanigans on the part of Yelp! The East Bay Express published <a href="http://www.eastbayexpress.com/gyrobase/yelp_and_the_business_of_extortion_2_0/Content?oid=927491&amp;page=1">an article last week</a> on Yelp's newest sales pitch to chefs and how it was gaining traction. Sales reps from the company are now calling restaurants with bad reviews posted and offering -- for a mere $299 a month -- to remove those bad reviews! As part of their service now, the folks at Yelp make money by cleaning up negative comments! Wow. Just Wow. What little shred of usability just went out the window. Talk about a no-negative review policy. How about we make some money on those?!</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">This cuts deeply into the trust of the "Average Joe."&nbsp; The reviews now mean nothing.&nbsp; If Yelp does this then who is to say that the other sites don't already do this or are going to follow suit.&nbsp; Our only hope is to educate the masses to not use sites like this and refer the reviews to the professionals (or educated armatures).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before you start throwing the freedom of speech argument at me, realize that I agree that everyone should have voice, but when that voice promotes corruption then the voice should be silenced.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>EDIT:&nbsp; I wanted defend <a href="http://www.angieslist.com/Angieslist/" target="_blank">Angie's List.</a> This is a review service that I have found to be extremely honest will continue to recommend them to everyone.</strong></p>
