excerpt: This is an update on my goals for the week of 9/30

These updates are from the [D for Definition](http://indytechcook.com/d-definition/) post.  If you haven't read that post please do!


### Goal:  New House

I'm investigating two solid leads for passive income streams.  These both will be hard work but will pay off.  I'll elaborate more when I make some more progress.

### Goal:  Write a book

I'm not sure this should be a goal anymore.  I wanted to write a book to help establish myself as a brand name and to be able to share a skill with others.  I think I'd be better at video.  I have a great energy when I'm in front of people that I can't seem to show in my writing.

### Goal: Win a weight Lifting Competition.

I'm not sure this is a practical or even good goal anymore.  What I really want to do is to feel better and I knew that could be achived by working out. I didn't want to put feeling better as a goal since it's not measurable.  I've also avoided putting down weight loss as a goal since I feel it's not sustainable but I think I'm chaining this goal to "Lose 20 lbs in 6 months and keep it off for 6 more."  This is long term, very difficult and measurable.

I'll be keeping the wight loss, food journal and activity tracking public on my [MyFitnessPal account](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/indytechcook).  This account is linked with my [FitBit account](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/indytechcook) which I [shared last week](http://indytechcook.com/goal-update-9-24/) but MyFitnesPal's food database is much larger.  Feel free to friend me and we can feel better together!

### Goal: Teach my daughter to read

We didn't get a chance to work much outside of her school last week.  My sister in-law was getting married and it was crazy every day.

### Goal: Have a monthly lunch with someone I admire

I've started reaching out to a few people but haven't made any connections yet.  I think I will extend this outside of lunch to meet people outside of Indianapolis.

### Attend social events more regularly

I had a great time at the wedding this weekend.  I met some new people, caught out with some I haven't seen in a while and general had a good time.  This is good for me to see how much fun it can be going out. 

This goal is probably going to go away in favor of improving my soft skills.  I'll talk about this more in the wrap up on this post.

### Cook Dinner twice a week

I cooked dinner last night.  We had Roasted Acorn Squash Stuffed w/ Mushroom & Sage and we had steamed broccoli on the side.  My wife said it was "flavorful" which is a huge compliment.  I was so excited with that response!  The recipe for the squash was from the [Reboot with Joe website](http://www.rebootwithjoe.com/) on page 22 of the [reboot plan](http://www.rebootwithjoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rbwj_15dayplan-FULLR_2.pdf)

### Until Next timeâ€¦

This week was more about reevaluating my goals than it was about making progress.  After reading an [article about why I might not be sticking to my plans](http://www.bombchelle.com/2012/planning-pitfalls/), I sat down and took a deep look at what my stated goals are and what I really want my life to look like.  In this process I decided it was best to change three of the goals.  This is not a set back but a step forward.  Self improvement is a learning process that is well, always changing.  You just have to roll with it.

I've also decided to add a new type of goal: personality trait changes.  This will help shape me into the person I really want to me by improving my soft skills.  The fact that these type of changes aren't really measurable is why I didn't include them before but they are an important part of my change process that I think is important to include.  I'll talk about this more in a future post.

As always, I look forward to your comments!
