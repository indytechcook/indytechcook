This is my first blog post.&nbsp; I'm moving to the 21st century.

I'm first subject will be about Baby Boo.&nbsp; That's right, I'm going to be a father.&nbsp; I am going to be a good father.&nbsp; I was raised by a good father and I surround myself with encouraging people.&nbsp; I am so excited to be a dad.&nbsp; It's going to fill this hole in my life.&nbsp; I don't always show my emotions but my excitement is hard to hide.

Now it's time forme to explain this picture (Not Shwown anymore).&nbsp; We received our first ultrasound earlier this week.&nbsp; It was the Monday after the Purdue-IU football game, the old Oaken Bucket.&nbsp; It was a great game, for Purdue.&nbsp; 62-10.&nbsp; We figured that Baby Boo was doing the touchdown sign.&nbsp; My wife did a little photoshoping to the picture and added the boarder.&nbsp; She is so talented at graphic design.&nbsp; If you look closely you can see the eyes and mouth.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">So Cool</span>

Well, that's it for post number one.&nbsp; I promise not to place to many personal stories in this blog.&nbsp; It just seemed like a good place to start.
