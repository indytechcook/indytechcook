### How I used to be

I used to live in my inbox.  I never closed it.  I was always the first to reply to an email and felt that made me more valuable.  What I didn't realize was how distracted this made me.  I thought I could multitask.  I thought I was special.  [I](http://www.forbes.com/sites/douglasmerrill/2012/08/17/why-multitasking-doesnt-work/) [thought](http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/you-cant-multitask/) [I](http://io9.com/5977798/think-you-can-multitask-congratulations-youre-probably-living-a-lie) [was](http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/dec2010/ca20101221_905115.htm) [different](http://www.neatorama.com/2008/03/20/the-brain-rules-why-the-brain-cant-multitask/).  Well, I'm not.  I can't beat science.


### Making the mental switch

Now that we have established that I'm not a superhuman, let's talk about how I used that information to control my inbox.  Using the techniques from The Four Hour Work Week's 80/20 rule, I evaluated that email was taking up 80% of my time but providing less then 20% value.  I begin to investigate methods to reduce my email consumption.  First there was the concepts from The Four Hour Work Week which was to check email only twice a day.  This was a start but I ended up being distracted thinking about what was in the email.  Was I going to miss something important?

After some investigation I found [AwayFind](http://www.awayfind.com/).  The tag line sold me: "Get AWAY from your inbox â€” let urgent emails cut through the clutter and FIND you...instantly."

EDIT:

I found [IfThisThenThat](http://ifttt.com), a service that allows you to setup condition and actions based upon cloud services.  I now use this service (mostly because it's free).  I setup a rule where any Gmail stared item gets texted to me.  THen I use Gmail fitters to look for patterns or people that I know I need to know about before the next email check (which I'm trying to get to once a day).  These include emails from my manager on up, new issues from our ticket system, mentions from Chatter (Saleforces' version of twitter) and anything from my wife.  Working great so far!


### Processing the inbox

Alright, so with the fear of missing an important email subsided, I can focus on treating processing my inbox like any other task.  Notice I used the word "process" and not check. I process my email inbox very deliberately.  

Using techniques from [http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/maintain-inbox-zero-daily-with-this-flow-chart/](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/maintain-inbox-zero-daily-with-this-flow-chart/), [http://www.activeinboxhq.com/blog/2013/07/26/a-flow-chart-for-inbox-zero](http://www.activeinboxhq.com/blog/2013/07/26/a-flow-chart-for-inbox-zero)/ and [http://www.43folders.com/izero](http://www.43folders.com/izero) I have setup the processing of my inbox using [ActiveInbox](http://www.activeinboxhq.com/referrals/?rc=9bim2k2131a&eh=dd6b6bf6005c43eabc894018cb03b641).  Here is how it goes.  Note that I'm using the beta version of [ActiveInbox Version 5](http://www.activeinboxhq.com/5_preview/help.php?eh=dd6b6bf6005c43eabc894018cb03b641).

### Actionable Tasks

Once I go through this process I have all of the emails that are tasks under the "Action" area in ActiveInbox.  Here is what that currently looks like:

<img class="left" src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s11/sh/7c4f5b90-88e4-4f40-8b8c-828ad3651c86/6acb96b64b86f54ca9b47d4034f6da3b/deep/0/Search%20results%20-%20neil.hastings@gmail.com%20-%20Gmail.png" alt="Search%20results%20-%20neil.hastings@gmail.com%20-%20Gmail" /> The two actions I currently have are actually from myself.  Using [ActiveInbox](http://www.activeinboxhq.com/referrals/?rc=9bim2k2131a&eh=dd6b6bf6005c43eabc894018cb03b641) provides an "Compose Self" button for quick task creation.


### Organizing Project Tasks

With the action list full of tasks it's time to organize and prioritize.  What's most import is defining what's the next task for each goal.  I use the Project Labels to assign tasks to goals and the "Next" label to define which task is next for each goal.  To maximize efficacy and reduce distractions, I visit each projects page to view the tasks.  [ActiveInbox](http://www.activeinboxhq.com/referrals/?rc=9bim2k2131a&eh=dd6b6bf6005c43eabc894018cb03b641) actually lets you manually sort the items in the list which is awesome! 
 

### Tomorrow's List

Along with moving away from checking email, I'm moving to creating my actionable task lists the night before so [I'm ready in the morning to get something done](http://indytechcook.com/being-purposeful/).  I pick the tasks that are next in the critical path for my goals.  These should be marked with a  "Next" tag.  I select the tasks and mark them with the "tomorrow" tag.

Now I'm ready to work on my tasks without checking my email.


### Working Today's Tasks

You may have noticed that I am actually still in Gmail when I'm working on my task list.  I use several tools to hide the "inbox" portion of Gmail and only look at Today's tasks.

First I create a bookmark pointing to the "Action" tasks (https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#apps/label%3As-action+-label%3As-finished).  I always enter Gmail from this link.  This way I have to purposely click the "Inbox" link to see the emails needed to be processed.  Form the action list I lick the "Today"" link.  Next I open the email I'm working on, remove the "Next" label and mark is as "In progress".  If an email is long then I use the notes feature of [ActiveInbox](http://www.activeinboxhq.com/referrals/?rc=9bim2k2131a&eh=dd6b6bf6005c43eabc894018cb03b641) to keep focused on the actionable part of the email.  The contextual information within the email is still important for the task at hand.

You can also add new information by replying to the email chain and only including yourself.


### Making Gmail better

To remove even more distractions I use a few chrome extensions to remove parts of the Gmail UI.

* [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) with [http://userstyles.org/styles/36980/gmail-autohide-sidebar](http://userstyles.org/styles/36980/gmail-autohide-sidebar) to remove the left sidebar.  This the simplest but most useful of the extensions I mention in this list.  The unread count, the inbox and label links is out of sight and out of mind.
* [Gmelius](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmelius-ad-blocker-and-be/dheionainndbbpoacpnopgmnihkcmnkl):  I've used just about every Gmail UI improvement plugin I could find and this one seems to work the best.  Along with making a few things prettier, it also removes the search bar which makes the task list that much closer to the top.

* [KeyRocket](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keyrocket-for-gmail/dmocchgkijnbjdjkmlglaemjhhdiobbp):  Keyboard shortcuts are awesome but hard to remember.  If you do an action that has a keyboard shortcut, this plugin will inform you of what keys you can use.  This has really help me move through my inbox processing faster.


### Ending

I've been using this process for a few weeks now have have noticed a measurable increase in the amount of time I can dedicate to wide variety of tasks.  I feel more productive and positive about my day.

Even with the removal of as many distractions as possible, the fact that I'm still in Gmail is in my mind.  I have found myself checking my inbox more often when I complete my tasks for the day.  I should probably just walk away from my computer and accomplish one of my personal tasks/goals.  The problem is that I haven't defined those very clearly yet.  That will be the focus on the next blog post!

I've also been thinking about using a different task management program but have yet to find one I like as much as [ActiveInbox](http://www.activeinboxhq.com/referrals/?rc=9bim2k2131a&eh=dd6b6bf6005c43eabc894018cb03b641).  I really want to focus on today's tasks without seeing a large laundry list of tasks.  *If you know of something, please leave a comment!*
