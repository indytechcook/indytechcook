I'm just an ordinary guy with an ordinary up bringing who wants to be extraordinary. Follow me on my journey through life as I look for how to improve myself and the world around me.

### Background

I grew up in a very normal family in Indianapolis, Indiana.  You didn't get much more midwestern the my family.  We have good values, loved and supported each other and are all generally good people.  We were a middle class family with a middle class life.

I'm just like you.  I haven't had to fight any sort of major adversity.  I haven't had to struggle with money.  I have never made a lot of money.  I'm just a guy who lives in the midwest.  The most adversity I've faced finically was being being really poor in college.  Nothing special.

### Continual self-improvement

I am on a journey of continual self-improvement.  I'm always looking for more tools, books and any other information that will make me more effective and efficient.  

Let me teach you how to make the most of your time so you can spend it doing what you want.  I have chosen to spend my time with my wife and two lovely children.  What will you do with your extra time?
